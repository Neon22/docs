# What is PyScript?

[PyScript](https://pyscript.net) is an
[open source](../../license/) platform for
[Python](https://python.org) in the
[browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser).

PyScript brings together two of the most vibrant technical ecosystems on the
planet. If [the web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) and Python
had a baby, you'd get PyScript.

PyScript works because modern browsers support
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (abbreviated to WASM) - an
[instruction set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture)
for a [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) with
an open specification and near native performance. PyScript takes
versions of the Python interpreter compiled to WASM, and makes them easy to use
inside the browser.

At the core of PyScript is a _philosophy of digital empowerment_. The web is
the world's most ubiquitous computing platform, mature and familiar to billions
of people. Python is one of the
[world's most popular programming languages](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-top-programming-languages-2023):
it is easy to teach and learn, used in a plethora of existing domains
(such as data science, games, embedded systems, artificial intelligence,
finance, physics  and film production - to name but a few), and the Python
ecosystem contains a huge number of popular and powerful libraries to address
its many uses.

PyScript brings together the ubiquity, familiarity and accessibility of the web
with the power, depth and expressiveness of Python. It means PyScript isn't
just for programming experts but, as we like to say, for the 99% of the rest of
the planet who use computers.
